# Hangman-Game

## About the App

This is a simple hangman game that is available to play on your free time. This will be the first application I will make after completing the coding bootcamp I enrolled into. Please enjoy the game and don't let that rage come into your head if you can't guess the word ðŸ˜Š.

## User Story

```
